        <article><h1 id="edgemultiplay-server">EdgeMultiplay Server</h1>
<p>EdgeMultiplay is a light game server sample that works with EdgeMultiplay Unity Client
This server is built using NodeJS</p>
<p>EdgeMultiplay uses a websocket server to communicate GameFlowEvents &amp; GamePlayEvents with the players(connections) and a UDP server to forward GamePlayEvents between players (such as positions and/or rotations).</p>
<p>The server have two main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>MatchMaking</li>
<li>Relay Server</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="matchmaking">MatchMaking</h3>
<p>The server is considered to be a Lobby, the lobby have rooms, players(connections) are assigned to rooms based on room vacancy only.</p>
<p>A Lobby is where all the rooms and the players' connections are stored, Think of a Lobby as the place where all the players hangout before they are matched to a room.</p>
<p>A Room is where the players are grouped together once the game starts players in the room can start forwarding messages between each other.</p>

<h3 id="relay-server">Relay Server</h3>
<p>A relay server does a single job which is forwarding a message from a player to other players in the same room (broadcasting).
A player can broadcast a message through websockets (if it's essential message, ex: score), or broadcast a message through udp (if it's not very important message, ex: position of a moving object).</p>
<h5 id="gameflowevents">GameFlowEvents</h5>
<p>There is 9 standard events on the server that represent the Game State before the GamePlay , see full list of GameFlowEvents in the <strong>Event</strong> class.</p>
<p><strong>GameStartEvent</strong> :  A game start event is sent once the number of room members reaches the maximum players per room.</p>
<p><strong>RoomJoinEvent</strong> : Room Join Event is sent from the server to the player once a JoinRoom request succeed.</p>
<p><strong>RoomCreatedEvent</strong> : Room Created Event is sent from the server to the player once a CreateRoom request succeed.</p>
<p><strong>RoomMemberLeftEvent</strong> :  RoomMemberLeftEvent is sent from the server to the room members once a room member leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>AvailableRoomsListEvent</strong> :  An event that contains the list of available rooms on the lobby, This is the response of EdgeManager.GetAvailableRooms().</p>
<p><strong>NotificationEvent</strong> :  a Notification Event sent from the server, there are some standard notifications (create-room-faliure, join-room-faliure, new-room-created-in-lobby).</p>
<p><strong>RegisterEvent</strong> : a Register Event sent from the server, Register Event is when the player establish its connection with the server and the player is assigned a player id and session id.</p>
<p><strong>PlayerJoinedRoomEvent</strong> : A Player Joined Room Event from the server, PlayerJoinedRoom Event is sent by the server to room members once a new player join their room.</p>
<p><strong>RoomsListEvent</strong> : An Event containing the list of rooms on the lobby, This is the response of EdgeManager.GetRooms().</p>
<h5 id="gameplayevent">GamePlayEvent</h5>
<p>There is a single GamePlayEvent, that is a wrapper for data to be trasnferred between players.</p></article>
